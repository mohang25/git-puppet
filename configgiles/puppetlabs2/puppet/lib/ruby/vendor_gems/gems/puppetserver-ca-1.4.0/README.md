# Puppet Server's CA CLI Library

This gem provides the functionality behind the Puppet Server CA interactions.
The actual CLI executable lives within the Puppet Server project.


## Installation

You may install it yourself with:

    $ gem install puppetserver-ca


## Usage

For initial CA setup, we provide two options. These need to be run before starting
Puppet Server for the first time.

To set up a default CA, with a self-signed root cert and an intermediate signing cert:
```
puppetserver ca setup
```

To import a custom CA:
```
puppetserver ca import --cert-bundle certs.pem --crl-chain crls.pem --private-key ca_key.pem
```

The remaining actions provided by this gem require a running Puppet Server, since
it primarily uses the CA's API endpoints to do its work. The following examples
assume that you are using the gem packaged within Puppet Server.

To sign a pending certificate request:
```
puppetserver ca sign --certname foo.example.com
```

To list certificates and CSRs:
```
puppetserver ca list --all
```

To revoke a signed certificate:
```
puppetserver ca revoke --certname foo.example.com
```

To revoke the cert and clean up all SSL files for a given certname:
```
puppetserver ca clean --certname foo.example.com
```

To create a new keypair and certificate for a certname:
```
puppetserver ca generate --certname foo.example.com
```

For more details, see the help output:
```
puppetserver ca --help
```
